/* A simple airport system consists of arriving airplanes, departing airplanes, 
 * and airplanes at gates and loading unloading areas (referred to in this 
 * documentation as bays). Airplanes approach the airport and communicate with 
 * the air traffic controller to determine when the plane can land. Once the 
 * landing conditions have been met, the airplane begins its landing procedure. 
 * After landing, the plane awaits an available gate or bay depending on the plane 
 * type. After a gate or bay becomes available, the plane will approach the gate 
 * and await passenger/cargo loading/unloading. After the plane has received its 
 * services at the gate/bay, the plane coordinates with the air traffic controller 
 * to approach the departure runway. When sufficient conditions have been met, 
 * the plane will enter the runway and takeoff.
